# Space-Rescue
A game about rescuing your fellow stranded astronauts. :)

  - I used Processing library for Java to make this game.
  - Object-Oriented program

P.S: Even though I implemented a RefreshGame method that resets all the game stats, still after losing the
     game the asteroids' speed remains the same and after winning it gets stuck in the win menu.
     I would appreciate someone fixing these bugs.
